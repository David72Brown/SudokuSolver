This program will solve any (soluble) sudoku, including 3D ones which use 9x9x9 cubes.

In the 2D sudokus, the 2 diagonals are expected to contain each digit 1-9 exactly once.
In the 3D sudokus, the 4 diagonals of the cube are expected to contain each digit 1-9 exactly once. (Those 4 diagonals are from the near left lower corner to the far right upper corner,
and from the near right lower corner to the far left upper corner.

It would be difficult for the user to input the starting sudoku, complete with a scattering of initial numbers to start things off, so you need to enter the sudoku in the relevant .cpp file
for the program to work on.
