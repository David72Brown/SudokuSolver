This program will solve any (soluble) sudoku, including 3D ones which use 9x9x9 cubes.
It also solves "killer" sudokus which are 2D sudokus which obey all the usual rules but additionally, areas of the 9x9 grid are divided up into irregularly shaped areas ("cages") and totals
are provided for the numbers within each cage.

In the 2D sudokus, the 2 diagonals are expected to contain each digit 1-9 exactly once.
In the 3D sudokus, the 4 diagonals of the cube are expected to contain each digit 1-9 exactly once. (Those 4 diagonals are from the near left lower corner to the far right upper corner,
and from the near right lower corner to the far left upper corner.

It would be difficult for the user to input the starting sudoku, complete with a scattering of initial numbers to start things off, so you need to enter the sudoku in the "Start grip.cpp"
file for the program to work on.
